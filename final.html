Sorry if the formatting is messy, I wrote each part whenever I couldn't sleep, whenever thoughts of us filled my mind and typed it down :)

I don't even know where to begin, because my heart has been hurting and feeling so heavy that sometimes its hard to breathe. This pain in my chest, it spreads through every part of me, and I can't control it. I really miss you. I miss us.

Four years...has been a long time. But I still remember the first day we met, the first time we embraced each other... like it was yesterday. It wasn't just a relationship to me, you were my home. You were my safe place, my best friend, my love, my weirdo, my partner in everything. You made my life feel brighter, funnier, softer and I always looked forward to a new day because you were in it.

I can still hear your voice, your laugh the way your touch made the world feel quiet and safe. I can still feel the way it felt to be close to you, like everything was gonna be okay as long as we were together and I wish to cling onto it forever, I don't want to forget how it feels like to be loved by you.

I made this website initially to propose to you, but as things changed...I decided to convert it into a memory lane as a space to hold onto everything we shared and a letter that expresses emotions from the bottom of my heart. Finishing it felt like reliving our whole relationship, replaying our moments, the good, the bad, the beautiful, the messy and they all feel so real, and it hurts. It really hurts. The trips we took, the inside jokes, the late-night talks, our movie nights, our gaming days, our pre-sleep wabi routine and even the arguments we had. I cherish it all, I really do.

You were the first person I truly let in, the only one I could be completely myself with. I hope you remember the adventures, the chaos, the laughter, the ups and downs. Haggling prices in Vietnam, trying new foods, discovering little corners of the world together‚Ä¶

Do you remember the ferry ride to bohol? When it turned into a roller coaster and we were laughing until you realized it was serious and froze in panic? You were so adorable, my cootie baby.

Or that moment in Anda, where we saw that drunk guy with a bolo when we wanted to check in at rose's apartments and we were scared? And when we went to the beach and it was raining, you were so upset that everything was ruined :( but I tried to salvage it, and I'm happy that I did, Even though I got sick afterward, the smile on your face made it all worth it. Your happiness is worth more than anything in the world to me.

Your happiness was everything.

You made me feel seen, you made me like I was worthy of love just for existing and it was nothing like I have ever felt before. You've shown me what it means to truly love and be loved. You taught me how to slow down and appreciate life, how to see beauty in the little things, and how to love with my whole heart. And I love you more deeply than I ever thought I could love anyone, you taught me true love.

You've helped me grow into a better person, more patient, more understanding, more open minded. I've learned so much about myself through you, and because of you. I learnt to be kinder because I wanted to be a good husband, a good father for the family I dreamed we'd have.

And with that love came mistakes. And I need to say this clearly: I am truly sorry.

I'm sorry for the times I let my flaws overshadow my love. I'm sorry for the words I didn't say when you needed comfort, for the moments I didn't show up the way you deserved. I never meant to cause you pain. If I could go back and fix the moments that hurt you, I would in a heartbeat, because you never deserved anything less than my full heart, my full presence, and my full love.

I'm sorry for the ways I hurt you, through my actions, words, silence, in not being who you needed me to be in certain moments. I hope you understand that I never meant to make you feel alone, unseen, or unloved. I know I did sometimes. And I carry that with me. Please know it was never a reflection of how much I cared for you, because I did. I still do and I always will, more than I can say.

My love, if I could go back and make it right, I would. I really would. I would hold you tighter. I would listen more. I would be more patient. I would love you the way you should be loved. I would fight harder, sooner. 

I know I've hurt you, I know my actions can never be justified nor undone. I tried to save our relationship for the past half a year or so, and I thought... it finally worked, I had you back... just for everything to be shattered overnight over something that could've easily been fixed...all because I thought giving you space was the right move. But perhaps this is what you've been wanting all this time, and I was trying to save something that was already gone. But I stil enjoyed the past half-year with you, even through the tough times. I'm sorry that my efforts weren't enough to save us, for you to forgive me.

I hope someday you can forgive me.

And I hope you'll see the beauty in the moments we've shared together, good and bad... and cherish them, just as I have.

I don't know what the future holds for us or if "us" even exists anymore. I don't know how much longer I still have you for, even at our current state. It feels like everyday we're drifting further and further apart, even as I put in effort to try to salvage what we still have. Maybe we will gradually drift apart as you move on and no longer need me, so maybe this is goodbye, or maybe time will bring us together again.... I do not know. But I do know this, you mattered to me more than anything else in this world. You changed my life. And I'll never forget that.

If this were another anniversary spent side by side, I'd say, "Here's to many more." More memories, more laughter, more growth. But if this is the end, I'll still carry you with me. Always.

Little Wabi will carry all my love for you. I hope he can be there for you when you're hurting. Please take care of him, okay?

Whatever happens, I truly hope you find happiness. I hope you find peace. I hope you find the love you deserve and feel loved. Whether it's by someone else, or by the healing you've done within yourself. But please never settle for anyone that isn't able to love you the way you should be loved, always keep the bar high, you deserve that.

Thank you babi. 
For your patience.
For forgiving me even when I didn't deserve it.
For your love even when things got hard.

Thank you for being the light in my life, for your kindness, your warmth, and the way you loved me despite my imperfections.

I've saved some of our most precious memories in this letter moments that represent just a small piece of the love we've shared. These moments meant the most to me, and are etched into my heart. I hope you remember us like that.

And if we drift apart or lose contact, if memories start to fade...this website will always exist, so you can revisit what we once were, our memories together.

You were my world. You brought joy, meaning, and a sense of home into my life that I never knew I needed until I met you.

I'll always be grateful for the time we shared, for the love we had, and for you, just as you are.

If there ever comes a day that you need me, I'll be here and you know where to find me.

Gihigugma tika my May.
ÊàëÁà±‰Ω† My babi, my woobi, my wabi, my woob woob, my weirdo, my everything.

I love you today, tomorrow, truly, deeply, and always.
